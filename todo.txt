For previous months?

Page 2 
- Improve Popup
- CSS: Don't show the fields literally as form fields.
- Days and OT fields are working.
- User can update the previous values for Paid salary and Monthly attendance.
- Only this month values are editable as it checks if current month values 
doens't exist, then add a new row (except advance)
- All the previous month values can only be edited by the admin.
- Different popup for all workers.
- Show the Foreign Key value not as a MultiChoice field.
- Show previous advances of current worker while adding more.
- For advance, add new row and update the total for this month.
- @login required
- Refresh the fields after adding new advance.
- Rounding off!

Page 3
- Show all the details(after calculating everything) of particular 
worker, for this month.

Common:
- Text in the center of input fields
- Created the tables, separate for the employee basic details.
- Separate table for advance so that if some employee is given advance more than 
one time in a month, enteries can be differentiated if needed. At first, we'll display 
only sum but details can be shown on click.
- Separate table for attendance connected with WorkerDetails so that there is no 
redundancy for worker details and easy to fetch the values.
- Separate table for Paid amount so that the respective values can be summed up
to show full paid amount in a month out of total salary. Its different than that 
of advance. 
- Balance amount(something not paid out of the total salary) for a month is to 
be saved in a different table. It will be saved here after Paid amount is added. 
The total amount and paid amount subtracted makes balance amount.
- Rest of the calculated values will be saved in separate table which needed to be 
shown if required, in WageDescription table. Here are the alues that are used to 
calculate the salary but are shown to user only in employee profile. 
- Look for extra code and remove it.
- Don't include base.html in login.html

------------------------FORMS AND VIEWS--------------------
- Cancelled: Had to submit data into tables directly as the models are defined, ModelForms 
are used directly. In which From first form, Foreign key value is copied to other
tables using commit = false, we can edit the values as we want and then save them.
Have ignored that field and doesn't appear to the user. 

- Custom HTML forms are generated which saves data through AJAX. Yet into the same thing.
- Views are used to save, update the form data.

------------------------TEMPLATE---------------------------
- Solved: Firstly the single form was shown, to copy ForeignKey value to other Forms and 
save but now for loop is user that gives same name to all fields in all forms and
it considers only the last form. So here is the problem till now. 
- Using one form for Page 2 and one for adding new worker.

------------------------OLD---------------------------

- Make the look proper with single time column name and respetive fields under 
it.
- Hide field names from every field and display once instead, either manualy or from DB. 
- Why Date is repeated? What to do with it? :P Editable as well as today?  
- What will happen to the ForeignKey attribute?
- Get the foreign key value from DB only. 
- Save all the forms but yet only last form is being considered.
- How to display, edit and save multiple forms.
- Display the values which are already entered in the Attendance, Paid and Advance fields.

------------------------CONFUSIONS---------------------------

- Date field should be editable or not? It will be kept default for this version.
- Use ModelForms or direct forms? Earlier the default behaviour was lost? So what? 
Can keep the model behaviour but ModelForms are not to be used.
- Use formsets or forms actually -> HTML forms for all the customization we need.
- Doing calculations? Need to save? Or only calculate right then? 
- Using id or class for CSS or JS? 
- Which JS, jQuery files to be included and in what order?
- Search for any month and year's records as "View only".
- In history, only show the clients that existed that time. 
- Search with name as well.
- PaySlip with all the details as on Page 3. Already there? Particulars, right?
