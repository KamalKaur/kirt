There are a lot of things to be done on single page so to avoid confusions 
about what to do first and what after that, here I'm appending the list:

1. Make the look proper with single time column name and respetive fields under 
it.
	- Hide field names from every field and display once instead, either manualy 
	or from DB.
	- Why Date is repeated? What to do with it? :P Editable as well as today?  
    - What will happen to the ForeignKey attribute?
2. Get the foreign key value from DB only. 
3. Save all the forms but yet only last form is being considered.
4. Display the values which are already entered in the fields after calculating 
them. (Seems tough)
5. How to display, edit and save multiple forms.

-----------------------CONFUSIONS-------------------------
Use ModelForms or direct forms? Default behaviour is lost? SO what?
Use formsets or forms actually? Looking into it!


Done till now: 
------------------------DATABASE---------------------------
- Created the tables, separate for the employee basic details.
- Separate table for advance so that if some employee is given advance more than 
one time in a month, it can be differentiated if needed. At first, we'll display 
only sum but later details can be shown.
- Separate table for attendance connected with WorkerDetails so that there is no 
redundancy for worker details and easy to fetch the values.
- Separate table for Paid amount so that the respective values can be summed up
to show full paid amount in a month out of total salary. Its different than that 
of advance. 
- Balance amount(something not paid out of the total salary) for a month is to 
be saved in a different table. It will be saved here after Paid amount is added. 
The total amount and paid amount subtracted makes balance amount.
- Rest of the alculated values will be saved in separate table which needed to be 
shown if required, in WageDescription table. Here are the alues that are used to 
calculate the salary but are shown to user only in employee profile. 

------------------------FORMS AND VIEWS--------------------
- Had to submit data into tables directly as the models are defined, ModelForms 
are used directly. In which From first form, Foreign key value is copied to other
tables using ommit = false, we can edit the values as we want and then save them.
Have ignored that field and doesn't appear to the user.

------------------------TEMPLATE---------------------------
- Firstly the single form was shown, to copy ForeignKey value to other Forms and 
save but now for loop is user that gives same name to all fields in all forms and
it considers only the last form. So here is the problem till now.
