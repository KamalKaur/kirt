# This file contains the variable values that are used in salary calculations
# Because not everyone calculates the OT, the same way. Some does gives OT wages
# 1.5 times the basic wage, but others just 1 times the basic wage, So two variables
# are to be associated: Factor to multiply to calculate basic wage and no. of hours
# they consider in a day. Some take it as 9, and others take it as 8 or may be
# someone else has a different duration of man hours.

# Sokhis have man hours in a day = 9

_MAN_HOURS_A_DAY = 9
_OVERTIME_WAGE_FACTOR = 1.5
